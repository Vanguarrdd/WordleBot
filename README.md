# WordleBot
# My first somewhat decent project in python
# HOW IT WORKS:
# enter your yellow characters first
# then enter your grey characters
# and lastly you'll be prompted to enter one green character (if you have one)
# and then another green character (if you have another one)
# you must also include the index at which that green character appears at (index starts at 0)
# then a list of lowercase english words will be displayed in the terminal for you to choose from
# Enjoy!
